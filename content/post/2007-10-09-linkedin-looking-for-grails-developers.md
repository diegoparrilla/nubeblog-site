I have received information about open positions in [Linkedin for Grails developers](http://www.linkedin.com/jobs?viewJob=&jobId=373610&fromSearch=6&sik=1191476395753). This is very interesting because it seems that big companies have realized of the potential of Grails.  
I think [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/) is the biggest professional network site with more than 14 million users (Via wikipedia).  
It sounds like a very interesting place to work, a pity I&#8217;m not in the Bay Area. üôÅ
