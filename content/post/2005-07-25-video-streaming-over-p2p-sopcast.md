One of the most interesting projects recently is [SopCast](http://www.sopcast.org/). The developers define it as &#8216;a simple, easy to use system to watch stream media on the Internet: a Network Media Broadcasting System&#8217;. Basically it allows to receive and broadcast video (and audio) signal using a P2P protocol, similar to Bittorrent. This means that while we are watching a broadcast we are receiving the information from multiple sources, and we are distributing the signal at the same time.  
I was surprised with the quality: it takes about one minute to get a stable streaming, and the quality is sustained. The more users watching the channel, the better the signal.  
The solution is still young, but I guess it is going to be a success. There are just a fistfull of channels, but they will probably grow very soon.
