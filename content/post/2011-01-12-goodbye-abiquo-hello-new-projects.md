Last December my working relationship with Abiquo terminated. I must admit that it was a fantastic experience to be involved in first-person role in creating a product that had real potential to become a world reference for a new industry. I&#8217;ve met people with an unusual talent that certainly has enriched me as a person and professional. But mostly I stay with the team with whom I had the honor of working and managing Abiquo: Xavi, Helena, Diego, MonleÃ³n &#8230; really, thank you for having been me involved in this.

I also want to thank you the engineering team. Sorry, I cannot name you one by one because you are so many now, but I can assure you that I will miss you. I will be there if you need me, no doubt. By the way, I&#8217;m still waiting for the payment of the Hudson Broken builds, you know ðŸ˜‰

Why I am no longer with Abiquo? Well &#8230; David Cantolla (The Pocoyo / Zinkia) I think he [got it right in this interview in Cotizalia](http://www.cotizalia.com/emprendedores/david-cantolla-vodka-capital-bitoon-20101115-61029.html)

> _**Question: What Zinkia mistakes you&#8217;ve learned and have not done this time?**_
> 
> _Answer: What I learned from Zinkia is the important thing was not the destination but the journey and who are in that way. If the philosophies of the people that we&#8217;re building are the same in the end you have a trip to a beautiful place &#8230;. It&#8217;s like if you go to India &#8230; but you go on a trip organized and next to you there are a few guys who do not agree with you and give you travel. At the end you have a trip that was very nice destination, but it was a very uncomfortable way._

> _Now I just want to walk, I want to do things and do them with people they want and I want and the way I care for and respect me and I them. If you put experience, a good project quality, equipment, funding, you are honest and you donâ€™t loose your mind about the money things tend to do well._

Whatâ€™s next? Well &#8230; my head is buzzing with new projects and plans for world domination. Abiquo is only a stage in my journey, and the journey includes the vast world of Cloud Computing. In a different way, but we&#8217;ll be there. I think I can help many companies to take that step towards the Infraestructure as a Â Services, leaving the philosophy apart.

So donâ€™t hesitate to contact me, I am available.
