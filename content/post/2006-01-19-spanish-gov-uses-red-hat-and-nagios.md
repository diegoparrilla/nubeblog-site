Reading the spanish newspaper [el mundo](http://www.elmundo.es) you can find information about the new application platform to link all the different administrations of the Spanish goverment [Sevilla anuncia un nuevo &#8216;cerebro&#8217; para la Administraci√≥n](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elmundo.es%2Fnavegante%2F2006%2F01%2F19%2Fesociedad%2F1137669742.html&langpair=es%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&prev=%2Flanguage_tools) (click on it to read it translated to english by google). Ok, news about a new system in the administration is not big deal&#8230;  
But if you analize the picture of the TFT screen, you can see how they are using NAGIOS and Red Hat Linux. You can see some Sun servers too(this is not new since Sun is a big provider of Spanish administrations).  
Everybody accepts Linux today as an Enteprise OS, but what about NAGIOS? Is it good enough to fight in the arena of products like HP Openview or BMC Patrol? It seems so.
