I have not been able to use <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Skype</span> for more than 24 hours, just like the rest of the world. It seems that the problem is serious. It has been reported that it&#8217;s an issue with a new version of the application. But it&#8217;s not so clear. Such a long outage must come from (and I&#8217;m speculating):

1) A failure in the data migration from the early version of the application and a bad (or nonexistent) rollback process.  
2) Massive failure in the storage and problems with the recovery process (I have seen this problem a lot of times).  
3) <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Skype</span> has been hijacked by malicious hackers. I don&#8217;t believe it.

Whatever it is, [it&#8217;s costing eBay one billion dollars](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=ebay). That&#8217;s more than $11000 per second. Let&#8217;s see if they can fix the problem before the markets open.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Update 17/08/2006 13:16 GMT+2:</span> It seems that an exploit that causes a denial of service [was published by an anonymous user in SecurityLab.ru](http://www.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Full-Disclosure/2007-08/msg00328.html).
