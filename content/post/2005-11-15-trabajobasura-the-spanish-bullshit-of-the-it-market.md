It&#8217;s a funny thing this [](http://www.trabajobasura.com/)[www.trabajobasura.com](http://www.trabajobasura.com) site. This spanish website helps you to know what the people say about a specific company. It is a fact that the spanish IT market is controlled by companies that basically plays the role of temporary staffing agencies. It is illegal to play this role in Spain (you need to be registered as a temporary agency instead of IT consultancy firm), but it seems that nobody will do nothing about this fraud. So, some companies treat workers as &#8216;flesh&#8217; to be reselled.

Hope this site help us to improve the quality of the IT work in Spain.
