This evening I was surprised with a message in my GMail screen: in red and bold the application advised me to switch off Firebug to improve the performance of the application. First I thought it was another update from Google, but when I saw at the top left &#8216;Older version&#8217; then it was clear: Google has just released a new version of GMail.  
And here comes the bad news: my own developed Greasemonkey scripts stopped working because of the massive changes in the inners of the application. The ids of the tags have changed, there is not frames any more, and the application do tricky things with the events. But the worst of all is the fact that Gmail is not working properly with my scripts!!! The &#8216;Compose&#8217; link does not work, and this is only after 30&#8242; of testing!
