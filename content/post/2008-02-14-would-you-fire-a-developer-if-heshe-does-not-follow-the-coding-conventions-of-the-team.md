There is a very interesting discussion about how good or bad are code reviews in [Martín Pérez&#8217;s Blog](http://brigomp.blogspot.com/2008/02/code-reviews-buena-o-mala-idea.html) (sorry, in Spanish!). Most of us think that the biggest problem of coding convention is the ego of the developers. But here comes something very difficult to manage, specially when adopting code reviews for the first time: what if some developers reject to follow the coding conventions? How can we enforce developers to follow coding conventions? And finally: is the replacement of the rebel developer by a new developer an option?
