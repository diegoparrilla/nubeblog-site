Yesterday I saw in the news this headlines &#8216; The City Council of Madrid will distribute software for citizens and enterprises for free&#8217;. The City Council has got an agreement with Sun Microsystems to distribute for free three million copies of StarOffice 7 and Java Desktop System. The market value of the agreement is 544 Million Euros.  
skeptic as I am about politicians, I thought I would need tons of papers and bureaucracy. If I&#8217;m lucky then I would receive the software some weeks later.  
But no, I just connected [here](http://www.munimadrid.es/mar) with Internet Explorer (Firefox does not work&#8230;), filled the form, and started downloading!!!
