This is one of the most horrendous and unbelievable news I have read in years. It seems that some [British authorities are considering the creation of DNA databases with primary school children](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/mar/16/youthjustice.children) that exhibit behaviour indicating they may become criminals in later life. So, if school can be hard for some children -specially difficult children-, can you imagine the stigmatization of being marked as &#8216;potential&#8217; criminals? This is absurd!

The article is really incredible, for example: &#8216;<span style="font-style: italic;">&#8230;placing primary school children who have not been arrested on the database is supported by elements of criminological theory&#8230;</span>&#8216; and &#8216;<span style="font-style: italic;">&#8230;it is possible to identify future offending traits in children as young as five&#8230;</span>&#8216;.

But what really scares me is the fact that teachers have the responsibility of identifying future offenders. Teachers are for teaching not to forecast the future behaviour of their pupils.
