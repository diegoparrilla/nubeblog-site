We are hiring Java contractors in Madrid, but we did not get a single resum√©. We posted several positions in the most famous job boards in Spain, but nobody have answered.  
There is no tradition of IT contractors in Spain, but&#8230; not a single resume? What is going on?  
If you want to work in Madrid as a Java contractor with us, please drop me a comment with your email and I will contact you. The comments are not public, so your email won&#8217;t be visible.
