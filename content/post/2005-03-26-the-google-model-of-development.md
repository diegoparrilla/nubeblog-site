I have read this [post](http://www.eightypercent.net/Archive/2005/03/24.html) about the Google model of development. It seems that Google encourages creativity in different ways, but they even let workers to spend 20% of their time in non-Google projects. And in working hours, not spare time.

I really envy Google&#8217;s workers. The fact is that running a small company 100% (200% should be better&#8230;) of my time is dedicated to have success in our projects. If a project fails, we will have problems in our finances, and may be we would have to lay off workers&#8230; But working in a big company everything is about burocracy and politics. If you don&#8217;t fit in the company politics (or get aligned, as they say), then you don&#8217;t have a commitment with the company. Absurd.

I have been looking for an environment like Google for years, and finally I bet my money and my future to my own company. May be one day, when I had the cash and the support of investors, I will follow the Google model. Meanwhile, I will dedicate the 200% of my spare time to &#8216;my projects&#8217;.
