I was astonished when I read that [Palm cancels Foleo just before starting to ship](http://http://blog.palm.com/palm/2007/09/a-message-to-pa.html) it. The reason sounds like an excuse: &#8216;<span style="font-style: italic;">&#8230;it has become clear that the right path for Palm is to offer a single, consistent user experience around this new platform[WindRiver] design and a single focus for our platform development efforts.</span>&#8216;  
There were rumours of delays because buggy software. The product was announced for shipping this summer, but the season was running out and there was not date for the product.  
What have happened? Who knows&#8230; The Foleo device were going to face a very [hard competition with the new low-end laptops](http://www.diegoparrilla.com/2007_06_01_archive.html). It sounds like they are rethinking the product. Meanwhile, this cancellation has cost to Palm 10 million dollars.
