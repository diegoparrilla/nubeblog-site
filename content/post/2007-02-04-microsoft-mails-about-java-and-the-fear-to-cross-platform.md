When I read the [slashdot post about internal emails from Microsoft](http://slashdot.org/articles/07/02/03/1524250.shtml), I did not realize of the content of [this email](http://www.iowaconsumercase.org/011107/PX_2768.pdf) until it was [posted in <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">javalobby</span>](http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t90205.html).

The content is scary. The mail thread comes from 1997, so after reading this emails, you can interpret the history of Java, .NET and Microsoft-Sun trial upon a several clear facts: 

  * Microsoft did not ever want to suport Java.
  * Microsoft does not care about cross-platform.
  * Microsoft wanted to &#8216;steal Java&#8217;, so they liked Java.
  * Microsoft commitment with open standards is &#8216;a politically charged topic&#8217;.
  * Microsoft did want to screw Sun.

Well, I have been working 13 years in the Technology Market, and when I hear expressions like &#8216;screw somebody/someone&#8217;, I know there is something very wrong with that person. And if that person is an engineer, then it is a bad engineer. A good engineer is always thinking on how to improve things, how to solve problems. NEVER on how to &#8216;screw&#8217; something. If this email is the &#8216;Microsoft way&#8217;, then I understand why they are losing all good engineers in favour of Google.

But what I have never, ever heard is the expression &#8216;let&#8217;s steal the technology to this guys&#8217;. Not even to business (evil&#8230;) people. I have words to explain my feelings about these kind of people, but I cannot use it in my blog. The pride of this expression is enormous and really scares me.

Everybody knows what happened after 1997: Microsoft put all their strengths to defeat Java&#8230; cloning Java. They created .NET, a rip off of Java to compete with Sun&#8217;s technology. Meanwhile, they forced Sun to take legal actions against them. Why? Because legal actions usually exhaust corporations. Microsoft knew they had more (financial) muscle, and that&#8217;s always a big advantage. Microsoft started to push some standards, and they even supported some cross-platform initiatives ([Mono](http://www.mono-project.com)).

After last agreement with <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Novell</span>, Microsoft put the cards on the table: Microsoft failed to defeat Java, .NET is complete failure -only Vb6 programmers are the only developers that have migrated-, and their hated cross-platform CAN work. It&#8217;s not surprise that Microsoft and <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Novell</span> signed and agreement to avoid legal actions because patent infringement. Microsoft have catch <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Novell</span> by its testicles, and who knows, may be SAMBA is not the only reason why they will not <span onclick="dr4sdgryt2(event)" style="cursor: pointer;">tighten them: may be it&#8217;s mono.</p>
