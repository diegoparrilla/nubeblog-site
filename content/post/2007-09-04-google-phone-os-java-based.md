I have just read this post in [Engadget about rumours of the Google Phone](http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/04/new-google-phone-rumors-get-real-specific/). I will highlight this: <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8216;&#8230;the phone will run on a Linux variant (which is nothing new), and will be Java Virtual Machine-capable. Additionally, the OS of the phone will be Java-based (as well as the all phone apps itself), and performance is said to be &#8220;very responsive.&#8221;&#8216;</span>  
It seems the GPhone will look like a Palm Treo or Blackberry with a screen smaller than the IPhone.  
If these rumours are true, Google will become a big supporter of Java for interactive devices something the device market needs desperately to set free of the Windows Mobile and CF.NET slavery.
