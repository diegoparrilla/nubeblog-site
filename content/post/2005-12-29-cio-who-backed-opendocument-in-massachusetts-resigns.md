This is really bad news for the open-source community. The CIO that supported the adoption of OpenDocument in Massachusetts [resigns](http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?NewsID=13460&Page=1&pagePos=8). He could not stand the pressure.  
It is a shame what money can do. Nobody will believe that Microsoft is not responsible of this resign. Everybody knows &#8216;fair play&#8217; is not an attribute of Microsoft strategy (anybody remember the &#8216;IE embedded in Windows&#8217; affair? Shameful), but governments should take care of not letting these kind of companies do whatever they want.  
Nowadays there are thousands of companies and a fistfull of governments in the hands of the Microsoft products. And this is not acceptable. In Spain you don&#8217;t&#8217; have the chance to pay your taxes electronically if you don&#8217;t run a program under Windows. No chance for Linux and Mac users.  
If Microsoft can do what they want in a public affair like the OpenDocument in Massachusetts, I cannot imagine what they can do in private companies to get projects.
