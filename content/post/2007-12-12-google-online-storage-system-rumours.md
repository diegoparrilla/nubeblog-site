  I think this is not a new rumour, but this is the first time that <a href="http://www.isuppli.com/marketwatch/default.asp?id=424">I have read details on how the system could be</a>. The Google Online Storage System (GDrive?) could be for free up to 50Gb, and should be paid by the ads embedded in the storage website, a la Gmail. The report also tries to calculate the costs and the margin of the solution, but I think the calculations are too simple and bit naive.<br />Online Storage is not something new, but Google can monetize it to a scale that only them, Microsoft or Yahoo can do. 50Gb of storage for free is a lot of storage and I can guarantee you I have a lot of old stuff I could put there, saving space in my disks, in my house (physical space is relevant) and of course is more accesible than DVDs or CDs.</p>
