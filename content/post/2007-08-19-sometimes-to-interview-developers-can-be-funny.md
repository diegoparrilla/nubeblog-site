I have interviewed a lot of developers, junior and senior staff and it has become like a routine. Technical workers are nice people, rude candidates are rare. Usually their (our) self-esteem make them (us) feel they need to show they (we) are over prepared for the job. The curriculum vitae are bloated with lots of technical buzzwords that most of the people have heard of, but can&#8217;t barely talk about them.  
I have compiled the list of events I can remember interviewing developers because they were funny, very funny:

This man had an impressive <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">cv</span> full of buzzwords, but he only worked in a single project.  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: So you have been working with J2<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">EE</span> for 4 years, right?</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #1: Right.</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: What&#8217;s your favourite <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">IDE</span>?</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #1: What?</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: What&#8217;s your favourite <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">IDE</span>. I-D-E. (Since this is an <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">English</span> acronym, I try with a vague <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">Spanish</span> translation: &#8216;<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">Entorno</span> <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">de</span> <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">Desarrollo</span>&#8216;.</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #1: Ah, Eclipse.</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">OK</span>. Which version of Eclipse?</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #1: The one for Java.</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: Yes, but what version, release, etc&#8230;</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #1: I don&#8217;t know. The architect tells me to use Eclipse&#8230;</span>  
The guy knew all the buzzwords, but he did not even know what the hell they meant.

This one did not learn the acronyms very well..  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: So you have been developing web applications with java for two years, right?</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #2: Right.</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: Are you using <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">JSTL</span>?</span>  
 <span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #2: Yes, of course!</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: Well, some developers feel <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">JSTL</span> does not help a lot&#8230;<interrupted></interrupted></span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #2: I don&#8217;t think web applications in java can be developed with <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">servlets</span>&#8230;</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: <silence>Sorry, I don&#8217;t understand.</silence></span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #2: With <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13">JSTL</span> Pages you can embed <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">your HTML</span> code easily. It&#8217;s very hard to embed the code in <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_15">Servlets</span>.</span>  
<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_16">JSTL</span> sounds very similar to <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_17">JSP</span> in <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_18">Spanish</span>&#8230; but only similar.

This one was so pathetic&#8230;  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: So you have been developing web applications for two years, right?</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #3: Right.</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: Which Application Server?</span>  
 <span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #3: <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_19">Weblogic</span></span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: Excellent! A good understanding of BEA <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_20">Weblogic</span> is a plus. Which version of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_21">Weblogic</span>?<br />Candidate #3: <silence> Version&#8230; 2</silence></span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: Â¿ 2 ? BEA <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_22">Weblogic</span> 2? Are you sure?</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #3: <silence> <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_23">Eeeehhh</span>&#8230; Yes, Java <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_24">Weblogic</span> 2 Enterprise Edition.<br />Me: &#8230; sorry, I think you don&#8217;t have good coverage there, I can&#8217;t here you very well&#8230; I will call you again <hang>&#8230;</hang></silence></span>  
I was not brave enough to continue with the interview without laughing.

This women really had a bad time  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: Your technical profile is excellent. As you know, spoken <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_25">English</span> is a must for this position.<br /></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #4: I know.<br /></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Me: Can you continue the interview in <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_26">English</span>?</span>  
 <span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #4: <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_27">OK</span>&#8230;<br /></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Me: (I looked at my notes for a couple of seconds, and then I heard something bumping on the floor. She was laying there!)<then></then></span>The woman <span onclick="dr4sdgryt2(event)" style="cursor: pointer;">lost consciousness </span> for a few seconds. She told me she did not expect an interview in <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_28">English</span>. That&#8217;s what I call a shocking question.

Architect by default  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: So you are the architect of an enterprise class application for a <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_29">Telco</span>, right?</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #5: Right.</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: What app server are you using?<br /></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #5: Tomcat<br /></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Me: Which version of Tomcat?<br /></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #5: 1.4<br />Me: I see&#8230; 1.4, and which version of the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_30">JVM</span>?<br />Candidate #5: 5<br />Me: Right, right&#8230; Are you sure?<br />Candidate #5: Sure.<br />Me: Why are you using Tomcat 1.4?<br />Candidate #5: Well&#8230; actually&#8230; the former architect chose it. I don&#8217;t know why we use 1.4.<br />Me: Why are you using <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_31">JVM</span> 5, then?<br /></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #5: Well&#8230; actually&#8230; the former architect chose it. I don&#8217;t know why we use 5.<br /></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Me: <upset>Look, there is no Tomcat 1.4, and in that <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_32">Telco</span> you can&#8217;t use <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_33">JVM</span> 5. Please be honest.<br />Candidate #5: Well&#8230; actually&#8230; the project is a nightmare and all the developers have left the team. I have not found a new job yet, and in order to keep me in the project, I was appointed Lead Architect by the top management. But I&#8217;m just looking for a new job and escape from that hell.</upset></span>  
Well, he was honest in the end.

And this is what happens when you interview a p
  
sycho  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: So you have been working as HTML and ASP developer, right?</span>   
<span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #666: Right.</span>   
<span style="font-style: italic;">Me: Can you tell what are your tasks in your current job.<br /></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #666: What do you mean?<br /></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Me: Just tell me what you are doing: what you develop, how, who is involved, technologies&#8230; it&#8217;s just to start the conversation<br /></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Candidate #666: Conversation?<br />Me: Yes, I think you are a bit tense. Please relax. Take your time to explain me your job.<br />Candidate #666: I&#8217;m no tense, but I don&#8217;t like your questions.<br />Me: <now> But we have not started yet&#8230; <well> Which <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_34">IDE</span> are you using to develop ASP pages?<br />Candidate #666: (silence, he starts to sweat)<silence><br />Me: Are you using a Microsoft <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_35">IDE</span>&#8230;?<br />Candidate #666: (he starts to breath anxiously)<silence...><br /></silence...></silence></well></now></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Me: <very>(Now I tense up&#8230;) &#8230;are you using Visual <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_36">Interdev</span>?<br />Candidate #666: (he stands up and look at me)<the> I have not came here to be judged, I just came here to be interviewed.</the></very></span>And he left the room while I was shitting my pants.
