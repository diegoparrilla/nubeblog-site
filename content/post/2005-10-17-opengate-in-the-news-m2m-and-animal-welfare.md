Today we read in the spanish newspaper [El Mundo](http://www.elmundo.es/) an article about one of the projects where the [Opengate M2M Middleware](http://www.opengate.es/) runs succesfully connecting the remote devices on the back of the spanish pigs to a web portal application. The article is [here (sorry, in spanish)](http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/10/17/ciencia/1129536048.html). The ham from the spanish &#8216;pata negra&#8217; pigs are extremely delicious and expensive. It is possible to track the positions of the pigs, how many kilometers they walk, their heartbeats, the luminosity, or the temperature.

We could never believe that one day our middleware could be used to track live animals!
