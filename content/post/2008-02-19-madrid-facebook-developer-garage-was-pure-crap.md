Yesterday I was in the event organized by [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) in Madrid, [The Madrid Facebook Developer Garage](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=20912900122). The event was organized by [FON](http://www.fon.com/), the Wifi company owned by [Martin Varsavsky](http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/). I think Mr. Varsavsky is doing a great job trying to give visibility of the European and specially Spanish companies in Silicon Valley. The event took place in Teatro Lara, a old-fashioned theater in the heart of Madrid. A nice place, nothing to do with a garage.  
Just like the content of the event: nothing to do with a developers garage. It was more like an introduction to Facebook. They sold the announcement of Facebook in spanish like an event for developers. Crap. Not a single word about how to develop applications. It was clearly an event focused on entrepreneurs and companies, not on developers. If I read &#8216;garage&#8217; and &#8216;developer&#8217;, it sounds to me like something closer to the bare metal, right? But it wasn&#8217;t.  
A waste of time. I hope Facebook will learn from this mistake and will make things better next time.
