Finally, BEA has released the final version of his long awaited Weblogic Application Server 9. You can start downloading the development version [here](http://commerce.bea.com/index.jsp).  
It is J2EE 1.4 compliant, and it implements a broad range of new services dedicated to make the mission critical applications easer to implement and manage. Since most of the J2EE projects can run now on a Open Source application server platform, BEA has evolved his application server to make it different from the JBoss, Geronimo, JOnAS, etc&#8230;  
If Weblogic 8.1 was far beyond the rest of the application servers, this one must be in another dimension.
