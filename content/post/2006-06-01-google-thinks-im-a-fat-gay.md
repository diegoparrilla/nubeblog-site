Today I have read a post in &#8216;[El mundo&#8217; about the experience of a journalist using GMail](http://navegante2.elmundo.es/navegante/2006/06/01/gadgetoblog/1149145645.html), and how the suggestions at the right hand side of the page can be really &#8216;scary&#8217;. He describe the feeling as the &#8216;HAL 9000 moment&#8217;.  
I tried with my own GMail account, and I opened one of my last personal emails: I sent a photograph of my six months daughter to two colleagues from the high school in my hometown, responding me when I&#8217;m going to come back to the town. They also sent back the photographs of their babies, with some of the stupid comments that daddies usually do&#8230;  
When I read the ads at the right hand side, I was really, really surprised: here goes the links that Google suggested:  
1) Dates for singles  
2) Male gay contacts  
3) Romantic dates  
4) How to loose weight easily.

Well, obviously Google thinks I have overweight, I&#8217;m single and I like to have sex with males&#8230;  
They did not hit on any of the suggestions: I&#8217;m not overweight (yet&#8230;), I&#8217;m happily married and I&#8217;m hetero.  
Google guys: improve the algorithm!
