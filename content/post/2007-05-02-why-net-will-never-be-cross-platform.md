When I read [this post](http://neosmart.net/blog/2007/please-microsoft-stop-holding-net-back/) asking Microsoft to make .NET cross-platform, I wondered myself why they did not use Java -the one and only <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">truly</span> cross-platform environment-. Apart from the the obvious, Microsoft has very good reason to avoid making .NET cross-platform: 

  1. The jewel of the crown is Windows, so opening .NET to OS X and Linux is like shooting on your feet.
  2. As Steve <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Ballmer</span> said he loves &#8216;developers&#8217;&#8230; because they build &#8216;applications&#8217;&#8230;for the Windows OS. Fuck the Linux communists and the OS X snobs! If you get the same functionality on a free OS, why are you going to pay for Windows?
  3. Performance and cross-platform do not match. The good performance of .NET comes from its architecture, using the Windows OS <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">APIs</span> when dealing with I/O and display. It took years to Java to improve his performance, and now they are taking an approach similar to .NET.
  4. Most of the people think that .NET is a rip off of Java. May be if .NET does not take the cross-platform way to avoid legal <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">IP</span> problems with SUN&#8230; who knows!
  5. Microsoft does not care about .NET. The real sources of incomes are Windows and Office licenses. .NET is the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">key lock</span> to keep developers in the Windows platform. If the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">key lock</span> is opened, then they should throw away the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">key lock</span> and buy a new one.
  6. Making .NET cross-platform is expensive, as SUN knows. If .NET does not give them direct revenue, there is no reason to invest on it. The business model is <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">nonexistent</span> for Microsoft.
