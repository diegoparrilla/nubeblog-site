  When there is shortage of talent and your offices are in Montana (USA) you need to squeeze your brains to find benefits to attract the very few talented developers to your company. <a href="http://www.fluxcorp.com/">Flux</a>, the company that developed the best Java Scheduler is <a href="http://www.fluxcorp.com/company/careers/">hiring </a>two developers and <a href="http://blogs.fluxcorp.com/blogs/david/2008/01/10/two-java-developer-jobs-flux">one of the benefits is an </a><b><a href="http://blogs.fluxcorp.com/blogs/david/2008/01/10/two-java-developer-jobs-flux">All Expense Paid, 7 Day Vacation for Two, Anywhere in the World!</a><br /></b><br />I don&#8217;t know if this is something common in the States, but from the perspective of a Spaniard this is absolutelly amazing. In Spain we can get paid : 
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      the expenses of our daily lunch (from 6€ to 10€ euros daily),
    </li>
    <li>
      private healthcare insurance (in Spain healthcare is free for 100% of the population, so this insurance helps you to get healthcare attention faster),
    </li>
    <li>
      languages courses (english basically)
    </li>
    <li>
      public transportation fees to the working place
    </li>
    <li>
      corporate mobile phone as private mobile phone (the private calls are paid by the employer).
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    If you are in a management position you can also get: 
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        life insurance
      </li>
      <li>
        retirement plan
      </li>
      <li>
        rented car (well, higher management positions&#8230;)
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Normally, these benefits are around 10% to 15% of your salary, so higher the salary (and the position) the more and better the benefits.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I&#8217;m very interested in knowing what are the benefits your employers (or you if your are an employer) give to talented people to attract them.
