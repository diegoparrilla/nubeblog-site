We are hiring Java Developers in Madrid. We have permanent and contract positions. Of course we are looking for people with an enthusiastic approach to the technology, and with experience in Java, Struts, JSPs, Javascript and DHTML. EJB3 and DWR will be welcomed, but you will have the chance to learn these technologies with us anyway!  
If you want to work in Madrid as a Java Developer please drop me a comment with your email and I will contact you. The comments are not public, so your email won&#8217;t be visible.
