Today [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) has acquired 1.6% of [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com), paying 240 million dollars. So the smart guys from Redmon (and their strategic consultants, of course) think Facebook has a value of 15 billion dollars! That&#8217;s a lot of money for a company with 300 employees! But it&#8217;s not about the employees talent, it&#8217;s about the 50 million active users of the platform where the value is. And it&#8217;s really high, around 300 bucks per active user.  
Now I think to myself&#8230; can they really get 300 dollars from the average user?  
It smells like dotcom boom reborn&#8230;
