Microsoft will supply the ECU (Electronic Control Units) to all the teams of Formula One beginning in 2008. Read all the article [here](http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/formulaone/27956/).  
In my opinion, this is really good news for Formula One fans, since &#8216;crashes&#8217; are one of the attractions of this sport event&#8230;

&#8230; and it&#8217;s good news for Kimi Raikonnen: now he can blame to M$ because of his bad luck.
