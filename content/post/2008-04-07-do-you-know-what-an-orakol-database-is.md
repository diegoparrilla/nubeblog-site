This is what I found today in ads at the top of the messages list in my GMail account:

[<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3095/2397053562_e86c53bdae.jpg" width="500" height="102" alt="orakol" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/dparrilla/2397053562/ "orakol por Diego Parrilla, en Flickr")

I took me a few seconds to figure out what the hell was an &#8216;Orakol&#8217; database&#8230; but when I guess it, I started laughing like crazy.

In Spain, people usually pronounce Oracle like they read it, and it&#8217;s different of the english pronounciation. If a Spaniard pronounces Oracle in english can sound snob, but writing it PHONETICALLY it&#8217;s not only snob, it&#8217;s very, very,very stupid.
