My friend [Diego Mari√±o](http://externalidades.net/acerca-de/) has announced in his blog that [they have succesfully connected a printer to a computing grid](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fexternalidades.net%2F2008%2F04%2F21%2Fimpresora-en-grid%2F&langpair=es%7Cen&hl=es&ie=UTF8). [Think in Grid](http://www.thinkingrid.com/) is a startup from Barcelona with an innovative Grid computing framework. They claim to be able to integrate all kind of devices in a computing grid, just like this printer:  
<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://externalidades.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/gridprinter.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px;" src="http://externalidades.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/gridprinter.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>  
Coming from the M2M busines I know that the Holy Grail of this business is not only the transparent connectivity of heterogenous devices through non-reliable (wireless) networks, but the capability to split and perform complex operations remotely just like if they were performed locally.

Obviously, it sounds promising.
