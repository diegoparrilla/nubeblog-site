[Werner Vogels](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/) -the Amazon CTO- has just announced in his blog the [availability of the S3 storage for Amazon European servers](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/11/amazon_s3_in_europe.html#trackback). This is good news because it means that Amazon thinks globally. The customer experience can improve if the latency is very low because of the fastest load of pages and static content.
