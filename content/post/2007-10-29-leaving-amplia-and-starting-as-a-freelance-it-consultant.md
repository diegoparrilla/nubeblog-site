Last years have been a wonderful time in [Ampl√≠a Soluciones S.L.](http://www.amplia.es), but nothing is forever and I think it&#8217;s time for a change. I will continue as a partner of the company but I will look for new challenges and adventures out there. You can [read my public linkedin profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/diegoparrilla) if you want to know a bit about my skills and experience.
