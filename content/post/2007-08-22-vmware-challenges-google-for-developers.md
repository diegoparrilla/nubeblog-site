Since the successful IPO of VMWare, it seems everybody is talking about them. Today we can read in [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=arqrCBynTOhA&refer=home) that they are competing with Google for the best programmers. VMWare is paying $120.000-$130.000 plus stock ops to talented developers. Compared to the spanish salaries that&#8217;s really a huge amount of money. They have right now [500 open positions in Palo Alto offices](http://www.vmware.com/company/jobs/openings/).
