C|Net and Univision have created a new [technology channel for Spanish speakers](http://www.univision.com/content/video.jhtml?cid=1463381&channelName=Videos&_requestid=43858). Good news&#8230; but when you hear Natali del Conte (former Techcrunch writer) speaking like a speech synthesizer, I wonder myself if they couldn&#8217;t find another person with a better spanish.
