Finally it seems that Ruby on Rails is starting to show its real face. [Two years of RoR development put into the trash](http://http//www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2007/09/7_reasons_i_switched_back_to_p_1.html). Wow! Being seven times more productive than Java that means fourteen years of development! Seriously, it&#8217;s not common to hear of failures of a new and cool software stuff -you can look stupid- so I guess this is the peak of the iceberg of Ruby On Rails projects. In my opinion, Ruby on Rails failed in this project because when dealing with the very small details of a project (that [5% of the project that takes 90% of the time](http://www.diegoparrilla.com/2007/08/being-project-manager-architect-analyst.html)) RoR convention over configuration approach fails. This, and of course integration with legacy systems (considering a database a legacy system). It&#8217;s clear that any other general purpose language and framework (JEE, .NET) can solve the integration problem better and faster.
