Jonathan Schwartz says in [SD-Asia](http://www.sda-asia.com/sda/news/psecom,id,17620,srn,4,nodeid,1,_language,Singapore.html): <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;&#8230;consumer cell phones on the Java software platform will drive demand for Sun servers&#8230;&#8221;. &#8220;The marketplace is going to be defined by the consuming public as much as by the traditional IT decision-maker&#8221;.</span>

Can anybody explain to me how does Sun think this is happening? How end-consumers can drive the adoption of a transparent server-side technology? End-consumer sees server side services as a commodity, they don&#8217;t care about the technology running the service if the service is good, reliable and cheap.

How can give me a clue?
