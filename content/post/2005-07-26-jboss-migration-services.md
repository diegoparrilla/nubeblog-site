Today I have received an email with a survey from JBoss. As an extract, it says _&#8230;Due to ongoing demand from our users, JBoss will soon be launching a new Migration Services program, to make the migration from commercial closed-source application servers to JBoss more efficient&#8230; &#8216;_.
  
  
I think they already have a migration tool for BEA Weblogic. I have already migrated some apps from Weblogic to Jboss (and from JBoss to Weblogic), and it is not difficult. Except if you try to get the same functionality in a clustered environment: then Weblogic rules.
