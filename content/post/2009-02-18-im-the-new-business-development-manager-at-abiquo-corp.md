It has been a very long time since my last post here. I would like to announce that I will start working for [Abiquo Corp](http://www.abiquo.com). as [Business Development Manager](http://www.linkedin.com/in/diegoparrilla).

Abiquo Corp. is an Spanish enterprise with a long experience in Grid Computing. Along 2008, they have reshaped their business towards Cloud Computing, developing an opensource platform to manage Private and Hybrid clouds. Our goal is to become one of the key players in Cloud Computing and Enterprise Opensource.

I will continue publishing my random thoughts about life, business and technology. One of my duties will be to feed the corporate blog, so you can [follow me in english here](http://blog.abiquo.com/), and if you want to [read me in spanish you can do it here](http://www.nubeblog.com).
