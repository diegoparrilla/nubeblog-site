[Evans data](http://www.evansdata.com) on his semi-annual Web Services Development Survey conducted in June says that companies planning the deployment of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">SOA</span> with a Java platform has increased slightly, but the companies deploying on .NET have <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">declined</span> by almost 20%. .NET is still ahead with a 31% and Java in second place with 28%. 25% will support both.  
It seems the reason is the increase of the activity of the Open Source world, specially Eclipse, around <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">SOA</span>.
