This week I have visited the [ESOC](http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/ESOC/index.html) (The European Space Operations Centre) as part of my new job in [The Server Labs](http://www.theserverlabs.com/). It has been a long time since I was in Germany last time, in the Due Diligence for the acquisition of [JobPilot](http://www.jobpilot.com/) by [Adecco](http://www.adecco.com/) (I was staff of Adecco). I think things have not change a lot: Germany is a good place to work if you are in technology: there are good companies, cutting edge research and development, multicultural environment, and people are really, really nice at work. This is also something I felt when I was working in [Consors](http://www.cortalconsors.com/) , and I have felt the same in the ESOC.  
In Spain people the attitude of people is more &#8216;defensive&#8217; and it can sometimes hurt the relationship between client and customer from the early beginning. And it&#8217;s not possible to compare the number of technological companies in Spain and in Germany.  
Still, I really missed something: the colours. May be it&#8217;s because of the weather, or because of the functional mentality of the people, but I missed the colours and the sun of Madrid.
