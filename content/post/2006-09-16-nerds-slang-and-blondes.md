May be you can feel identified with the guy dressing in black shirt in this [video from a Norwegian Reality Show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY_CidIS8YM): he tries to teach a girl how to change the processor in a PC, and the girl thinks the PC is the screen. Very funny&#8230;

When I was a student I shared a flat with two colleagues: one of them was studying business. In that time, we used a small 14.400 modem to connect to Internet. It was connected to the tower of the PC to a serial port, and you could barely see it.

He decided to buy a computer, and then he asked us to help him with the purchase. He said &#8220;I need a really powerful computer, so I want a computer with a BIG MODEM&#8221;. We thought that he was assuming that the bigger the modem, the fastest connection. We explained to him that 14.400 was the fastest connection at that time. But he insisted: &#8220;I don&#8217;t care, I want a really powerful computer with a BIG MODEM&#8221;. We answered: &#8220;Size does not matter if you want to connect to the Internet&#8221;.

We were shocked with the answer: &#8220;Internet? No, I don&#8217;t want to connect to that stupid thing of the Internet&#8230; I just want the computer to write my thesis, and if I buy a computer with a BIG MODEM, I can put more things inside, isn&#8217;t it!&#8221;. Jesus! He was thinking that a MODEM was the TOWER of a PC!

He saw that we were always asking each other (my other flat-mate and me) asking: &#8220;How is the modem?&#8221; to know the status of the modem before making any phone call, and looking to the PC Tower (the modem was connected there to the serial). So he thought that a MODEM was a Nerds&#8217; word for a PC.

We still laugh a lot about this little flat-mates story.
