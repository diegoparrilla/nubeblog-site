      <description>This is what I found today in ads at the top of the messages list in my GMail account:

I took me a few seconds to figure out what the hell was an ‘Orakol’ database… but when I guess it, I started laughing like crazy.
In Spain, people usually pronounce Oracle like they read it, and it’s different of the english pronounciation. If a Spaniard pronounces Oracle in english can sound snob, but writing it PHONETICALLY it’s not only snob, it’s very, very,very stupid.</description>

      <description>I hate all the articules predicting what will be cool in the new year. Ok, here goes my 5 stupid predictions for 2008. I have not analyzed markets, trends or purchased expensive reports to Gartner, just like most writers, but at least I admit it. May be some predictions sounds a bit apocalyptic, but hey! they are mine and I can do whatever I want with them!
 Java will die in 2008 and all the companies using it will be destroyed: Java dies every year as everybody knows.</description>
