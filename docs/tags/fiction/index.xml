      <description>This is one of the most horrendous and unbelievable news I have read in years. It seems that some British authorities are considering the creation of DNA databases with primary school children that exhibit behaviour indicating they may become criminals in later life. So, if school can be hard for some children -specially difficult children-, can you imagine the stigmatization of being marked as ‘potential’ criminals? This is absurd!
The article is really incredible, for example: ‘…placing primary school children who have not been arrested on the database is supported by elements of criminological theory…‘ and ‘…it is possible to identify future offending traits in children as young as five…‘.</description>
