      <description>C|Net and Univision have created a new technology channel for Spanish speakers. Good news… but when you hear Natali del Conte (former Techcrunch writer) speaking like a speech synthesizer, I wonder myself if they couldn’t find another person with a better spanish.

      <description>This evening I was surprised with a message in my GMail screen: in red and bold the application advised me to switch off Firebug to improve the performance of the application. First I thought it was another update from Google, but when I saw at the top left ‘Older version’ then it was clear: Google has just released a new version of GMail.
And here comes the bad news: my own developed Greasemonkey scripts stopped working because of the massive changes in the inners of the application.</description>

      <description>Looking for information on how to configure the Chillispot in my Soekris net4521 with Voyage Linux, the people from Poblete Wireless has blogged about a device that looks very similar to ‘La Fonera’, POBLETEWIRELESS: �Es esto el posible Fon Liberator?.
The device has been developed by Accton, and you can check the specs here.</description>

      <description>I have been tracking FON for two years, and I’m a ‘fonero’ since last summer. Recently I read about the ‘FON Liberator’ project, and it seems that finally the mystery of FON is over. If you analyze seriously the business model of this company and you have some basic knowledge about wireless networks, you easily find that something does not match. The original FON business model (and I say original, because now it has changed) was ‘share your bandwidth and you will have access to the enormous WiFi network of FON’.</description>
