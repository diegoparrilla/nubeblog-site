      <description>When I read the slashdot post about internal emails from Microsoft, I did not realize of the content of this email until it was posted in javalobby.
The content is scary. The mail thread comes from 1997, so after reading this emails, you can interpret the history of Java, .NET and Microsoft-Sun trial upon a several clear facts:
 Microsoft did not ever want to suport Java. Microsoft does not care about cross-platform.</description>

      <description>I don’t understand this recent campaign against Sony. As an example, here goes this post: Foreigners And Fights, PS3 JPN Launch’sDark Side – Kotaku.
Can anybody explain what the hell has to do this with Sony?
Update: There is a link in Slashdot. Shameful link, by the way… They don’t even treat Microsoft this way.</description>
