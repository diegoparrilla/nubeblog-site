      <description>C|Net and Univision have created a new technology channel for Spanish speakers. Good news… but when you hear Natali del Conte (former Techcrunch writer) speaking like a speech synthesizer, I wonder myself if they couldn’t find another person with a better spanish.

      <description>I hate all the articules predicting what will be cool in the new year. Ok, here goes my 5 stupid predictions for 2008. I have not analyzed markets, trends or purchased expensive reports to Gartner, just like most writers, but at least I admit it. May be some predictions sounds a bit apocalyptic, but hey! they are mine and I can do whatever I want with them!
 Java will die in 2008 and all the companies using it will be destroyed: Java dies every year as everybody knows.</description>

      <title>Rise and fall of DBAs: The tyranny of the ORM</title>

      <description>There was a time when DBAs dictate how developers should use Their databases. It was early and mid-nineties and Their Word was The Truth. Those poor guys building client-server applications had to bow down before Him/Her and implement the Business Logic inside The Database Manager. Database hardware was expensive, but His/Her Highness could size the system easily because the number of clients connected was predictable. And that’s what the IT Manager wanted; predictable figures.</description>

      <description>Recently I have discovered TouchGraph, a tool that reveals the network of connectivity between websites, as reported by Google’s database of related sites. I have tested it with this blog and the result is this:
The www.javablogs.com looks like this:
This tool can reveal how google see your website. Analyzing this information you can find out if your site is seen as a Java Blog or a Wireless network Blog, which is my case.</description>

      <title>Sometimes to interview developers can be funny</title>

      <description>I have interviewed a lot of developers, junior and senior staff and it has become like a routine. Technical workers are nice people, rude candidates are rare. Usually their (our) self-esteem make them (us) feel they need to show they (we) are over prepared for the job. The curriculum vitae are bloated with lots of technical buzzwords that most of the people have heard of, but can’t barely talk about them.</description>

      <description>If you are above thirties, do not visit chat rooms very often or English is not your mother tongue, then you probably waste most of the time trying to decipher that abbreviation lingo.
Here goes a brief dictionary of words.</description>

      <title>3D Mailbox, is this a joke?</title>

      <description>I recently found a review of a new email application name 3D Mailbox. And that’s what you think: an application to read your email in a tridimensional environment. Can sound stupid, but it looks even more stupid when you watch the trailer:
It’s crystal clear that Venture Capital investors do not know what to do with their pockets full of money.
And no, it’s not a joke.</description>

      <title>Is Google going to fire Isabel Aguilera soon?</title>

      <description>Today an online Spanishnewspaper congrats Isabel Aguilera(Google Spanish CEO) for not screwing up the purchase of DoubleClickby Google. Besides the sarcasm of the headlines, the newspaper says that the time of Isabel Aguilerain Google is running out, and she could leave the company very soon.
It’s not a surprise that she will leave the company (the surprise is she has not been fired yet). Reading the profile and curricula of this women, I wonder myself if Google contracted the wrong headhunter.</description>

      <description>I know this post has nothing to do with technology, except that my brother studied Electronic Engineering and later on decided to become a cinematographer director…
He has just finished a set of short films with some friends. You can watch them in Guris Guiris
Very funny indeed.</description>

      <description>I have been tracking FON for two years, and I’m a ‘fonero’ since last summer. Recently I read about the ‘FON Liberator’ project, and it seems that finally the mystery of FON is over. If you analyze seriously the business model of this company and you have some basic knowledge about wireless networks, you easily find that something does not match. The original FON business model (and I say original, because now it has changed) was ‘share your bandwidth and you will have access to the enormous WiFi network of FON’.</description>

      <description>This is the best story I have read in years. This poor asshole was the communications director for U.S. Rep. Denny Rehberg, R-Mont tried to hire hackers to raise his recorded grade point average[1].Sounds like something that only could happen in a sit-com, not in real life.</description>
