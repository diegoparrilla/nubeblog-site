      <description>I recently found a review of a new email application name 3D Mailbox. And that’s what you think: an application to read your email in a tridimensional environment. Can sound stupid, but it looks even more stupid when you watch the trailer:

      <description>I have just read this report from ellacoya networks. It explains how http traffic has overtaken p2p traffic thanks to video and audio streaming. And YouTube comprises 10% of whole internet traffic, and more than 20% of http!
I could never imagine that YouTube is so big. But what it makes me wonder how much time people waste in YouTube daily, and how it affects productivity.</description>
