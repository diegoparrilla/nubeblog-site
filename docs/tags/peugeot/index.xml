      <description>I donâ€™t like to talk about my personal life in this blog, but I had a rather unpleasant experience with the customer service of Peugeot,and I think they have comitted a mistake, and they want the users pay for their failures.I have created the blog www.averiaspeugeot307.com,if you know anyone who has problems with his/her 307, let them know about the site (in spanish).</description>
