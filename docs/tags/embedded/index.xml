      <description>My friend Diego Mariño has announced in his blog that they have succesfully connected a printer to a computing grid. Think in Grid is a startup from Barcelona with an innovative Grid computing framework. They claim to be able to integrate all kind of devices in a computing grid, just like this printer:
Coming from the M2M busines I know that the Holy Grail of this business is not only the transparent connectivity of heterogenous devices through non-reliable (wireless) networks, but the capability to split and perform complex operations remotely just like if they were performed locally.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you only need to wait to understand why things happen. When Steve Jobs said ‘Java is not worth building in. Nobody uses Java anymore. It’s this big heavyweight ball and chain’, we were surprised and disappointed because like me a lot of people think that there is still room for Java in the mobile platforms. Of course we have J2ME, but we can do very few things with it. What we need is a full J2SE stack for mobiles.</description>

      <description>I was astonished when I read that Palm cancels Foleo just before starting to ship it. The reason sounds like an excuse: ‘…it has become clear that the right path for Palm is to offer a single, consistent user experience around this new platform[WindRiver] design and a single focus for our platform development efforts.‘
There were rumours of delays because buggy software. The product was announced for shipping this summer, but the season was running out and there was not date for the product.</description>

      <title>Google Phone OS Java based?</title>

      <description>I have just read this post in Engadget about rumours of the Google Phone. I will highlight this: ‘…the phone will run on a Linux variant (which is nothing new), and will be Java Virtual Machine-capable. Additionally, the OS of the phone will be Java-based (as well as the all phone apps itself), and performance is said to be “very responsive.”‘It seems the GPhone will look like a Palm Treo or Blackberry with a screen smaller than the IPhone.</description>

      <title>Bad times for J2ME. How the iPhone with Web 2.0 apps can rule in the mobile world</title>

      <description>The day Steve Jobs said ‘Java’s not worth building in. Nobody uses Java anymore. It’s this big heavyweight ball and chain’ . Being a Java Zealot as I am, I should find easily a fist full of arguments, but may be he is right.
I have been working in the embedded and mobile world for almost four years in Amplia, and I can tell you that Java is far from being the best option for mobile and embedded development.</description>

      <description>Looking for information on how to configure the Chillispot in my Soekris net4521 with Voyage Linux, the people from Poblete Wireless has blogged about a device that looks very similar to ‘La Fonera’, POBLETEWIRELESS: �Es esto el posible Fon Liberator?.
The device has been developed by Accton, and you can check the specs here.</description>

      <title>The killer app of FON will be access to P2P networks</title>

      <description>I have been tracking FON for two years, and I’m a ‘fonero’ since last summer. Recently I read about the ‘FON Liberator’ project, and it seems that finally the mystery of FON is over. If you analyze seriously the business model of this company and you have some basic knowledge about wireless networks, you easily find that something does not match. The original FON business model (and I say original, because now it has changed) was ‘share your bandwidth and you will have access to the enormous WiFi network of FON’.</description>
