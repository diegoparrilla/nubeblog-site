      <description>Datacenter knowledge ha publicado un estudio en el que sugiere que Facebook gasta aproximadamente unos $50M al año en alquiler de espacio en Centros de Datos por todos los EEUU.
La factura ha crecido de $20M en 2009 a la cifra estimada este año debido al crecimiento de la red social desde los 200 millones de usuarios a los 500 millones.
A estos $50M hay que sumarle la potencía eléctrica necesaria para alimentar a los más de 60.</description>

      <description>Hoy miércoles empieza oficialmente el evento Dreamforce 2009 de Salesforce. Aunque el lunes y el martes se han dedicado a realizar actividades más pequeñas de formación y difusión, así como el registro.
Lo primero que te llama la atención del evento es el tamaño. Se habla de 12000 asistentes. La sala de la KeyNote es inmensa (unos 10000 en la sala), nada comparado a lo que he visto en Europa. Para hacer un símil, llenad de sillas uno de los pabellos grandes de IFEMA y tenéis algo que se aproxima.</description>

      <description>Nuestro partner de comunidad NEXICA me informa que el próximo 3 de junio en Madrid va a celebrar un Desayuno Tecnológico sobre Aceleración de Aplicaciones. Los ponentes son Brian Cowe, Ingeniero de sistemas de Zeus Technology Ltd. y Sergi Morales, Director de Desarrollo de Servicio de Nexica. Da la casualidad que en Abiquo estamos especialmente interesados en los productos de Zeus ya que están muy bien pensados para arquitecturas Cloud tipo IaaS (Infraestructura como Servicio), y espero que en breve anunciemos cosas al respecto.</description>

      <description>No me gusta escribir en caliente, prefiero reposar las cosas, pero me siento absolutamente indefenso ante lo que me está pasando con Openbank.
Ayer jueves por la noche intenté entrar en mi cuenta de Openbank, como suelo hacer desde hace casi 10 años casi todas las semanas. Pruebo varias y veces, y nada, me devuelve a la pantalla principal. No me sale el típico mensaje de error de usuario y password erróneos, o similares.</description>

      <description>Nicholas Carr acaba de sacar una nueva versión del libro de cabecera sobre Cloud Computing, “The Big Switch”. Esta nueva edición con tapas blandas trae un nuevo capítulo llamado ‘The Cloud 20’. En este capítulo el autor analiza 20 compañias líderes en el mundo del Cloud. Y aquí es donde se ha creado la controversia. Al igual que cuando un seleccionador no convoca a un jugador sus seguidores se enfadan, lo mismo ha pasado con esta selección.</description>

      <description>Esta noticia si que la estaba esperando: Amazon EC2 tendrá dos zonas disponibles en Europa. Leo en el blog del CTO de Amazon Werner Vogels que finalmente se ha lanzado el servicio debido a las numerosas peticiones de sus clientes en Europa (incluida la mía).
Las principales ventajas para los Europeos se pueden resumir en:
 La menor latencia de acceso hace que los servicios sean más rápidos a este lado del atlántico.</description>

      <description>Decho es el nombre de una nueva compañía que EMC ha creado y que se centrará en los Servicios de Información orientados a consumidores. Esta compañía se ha creado gracias a la combinación de dos empresas de EMC, Mozy y Pi. El nombre elegido, Decho, es la combinación de dos palabras: Digital y Echo.
Esta nueva unidad de negocio ofrecerá servicios en La Nube de compartición y almacenaje de información en la Web.</description>

      <description>El viernes leí la noticia de nuevos despidos en Sun. Esto no es nuevo, cada 2 años hacen lo mismo. Me acordé de un chiste malo que me contaron hace unos años sobre Sun y Microsoft:
 – Tio, no se si hacer este proyecto con Java o con C#…
– Vamos a ver…¿Tu has visto Armageddon?
– ¿La de Bruce Willis y el asteroide? Sí, la he visto…
– Pues figúrate que en vez de llamar a Bruce Willis y su banda, tienes que llamar a la mejor empresa de ingeniería informática del mundo: ¿A quién llamarías, a Sun o a Microsoft?</description>

      <description>Parece que no estoy solo en mis impresiones sobre lo decepcionante que ha sido el SLA de Amazon EC2. En la lista de correo sobre Cloud Computing de Google podemos leer en este hilo una serie de comentarios realmente interesantes. Publico algunos de ellos:
 …Nuestros abogados revisaron el Acuerdo de Servicio de EC2 y dicen que es completamente inaceptable, excepto para I+D. Amazon no asume ninguna responsabilidad por nada, y pueden cambiar unilateralmente el Acuerdo de Servicio en cualquier momento.</description>

      <description>My friend Diego Mariño has announced in his blog that they have succesfully connected a printer to a computing grid. Think in Grid is a startup from Barcelona with an innovative Grid computing framework. They claim to be able to integrate all kind of devices in a computing grid, just like this printer:
Coming from the M2M busines I know that the Holy Grail of this business is not only the transparent connectivity of heterogenous devices through non-reliable (wireless) networks, but the capability to split and perform complex operations remotely just like if they were performed locally.</description>

      <description>Yesterday we discover that Mowser, the project founded by famous blogger Russell Beattie (and former colleague) was in the deadpool. Russ claimed that he ran out of money and had serious trouble with his finances.
Everyday startups are created and abandoned, but the point in this story is that he could not raise funds to continue with the project. We see almost everyday projects raising a lot of money for nothing, so why an authority in the mobile world cannot pass the first round?</description>

      <description>This is what I found today in ads at the top of the messages list in my GMail account:

I took me a few seconds to figure out what the hell was an ‘Orakol’ database… but when I guess it, I started laughing like crazy.
In Spain, people usually pronounce Oracle like they read it, and it’s different of the english pronounciation. If a Spaniard pronounces Oracle in english can sound snob, but writing it PHONETICALLY it’s not only snob, it’s very, very,very stupid.</description>

      <description>This is one of the most horrendous and unbelievable news I have read in years. It seems that some British authorities are considering the creation of DNA databases with primary school children that exhibit behaviour indicating they may become criminals in later life. So, if school can be hard for some children -specially difficult children-, can you imagine the stigmatization of being marked as ‘potential’ criminals? This is absurd!
The article is really incredible, for example: ‘…placing primary school children who have not been arrested on the database is supported by elements of criminological theory…‘ and ‘…it is possible to identify future offending traits in children as young as five…‘.</description>

      <description>Previous: Grails, is it really worth it?
I think there is a general misunderstanding of what kind of value can give Grails to a development shop. It seems that there are people out there that believe Grails, RoR and other breeds mean the end of Software Architectures in the web layer. The reasoning is: if the workload to develop a web application is shorter probably it means we need less skilled developers to code our applications.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was in the event organized by Facebook in Madrid, The Madrid Facebook Developer Garage. The event was organized by FON, the Wifi company owned by Martin Varsavsky. I think Mr. Varsavsky is doing a great job trying to give visibility of the European and specially Spanish companies in Silicon Valley. The event took place in Teatro Lara, a old-fashioned theater in the heart of Madrid. A nice place, nothing to do with a garage.</description>

      <description>There is a very interesting discussion about how good or bad are code reviews in Martín Pérez’s Blog (sorry, in Spanish!). Most of us think that the biggest problem of coding convention is the ego of the developers. But here comes something very difficult to manage, specially when adopting code reviews for the first time: what if some developers reject to follow the coding conventions? How can we enforce developers to follow coding conventions?</description>

It has been a long time since I was in Germany last time, in the Due Diligence for the acquisition of JobPilot by Adecco (I was staff of Adecco). I think things have not change a lot: Germany is a good place to work if you are in technology: there are good companies, cutting edge research and development, multicultural environment, and people are really, really nice at work.</description>

I have not analyzed markets, trends or purchased expensive reports to Gartner, just like most writers, but at least I admit it. May be some predictions sounds a bit apocalyptic, but hey! they are mine and I can do whatever I want with them!
 Java will die in 2008 and all the companies using it will be destroyed: Java dies every year as everybody knows.</description>

      <description>Long time ago Network Solutions was the only domain registrar of .com domains, and so you had to pay them for the registration. But the monopoly ended several years ago, and discount domain registars are eating their business. They still charge $35 per year for a .com registration when you can find registrars for less than $9. Obviously they still get a lot of money from renewals, but I guess they business is not growing anymore, because they don’t want to compete with discount registrars.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you only need to wait to understand why things happen. When Steve Jobs said ‘Java is not worth building in. Nobody uses Java anymore. It’s this big heavyweight ball and chain’, we were surprised and disappointed because like me a lot of people think that there is still room for Java in the mobile platforms. Of course we have J2ME, but we can do very few things with it. What we need is a full J2SE stack for mobiles.</description>

      <description>Werner Vogels -the Amazon CTO- has just announced in his blog the availability of the S3 storage for Amazon European servers. This is good news because it means that Amazon thinks globally. The customer experience can improve if the latency is very low because of the fastest load of pages and static content.</description>

      <description>When you start with a third party open source library or project, first thing you do is to check the its activity. If the project is dead or it’s a zombie (somebody still there just to make questions in the forums) then it’s better to start looking for a new one.
If the project is active and you decide to use it, sometimes (well, most of the times) you cannot dedicate time to give your feedback to the project.</description>

      <description>Enough is enough. For years the students and professionals of Masters and Degrees of Computer Sciences/Engineering in Spain have been marginalized of the rest of the Engineering members. The government has even denied the existence of our Master and Degrees, when they are official studies in the Spanish universities. The number of people working in IT in Spain coming from other areas is enormous, and there are a lot of companies -IT consultancy and services- that does not even have a single professional with a Master or a Degree in CS.</description>

First I thought it was another update from Google, but when I saw at the top left ‘Older version’ then it was clear: Google has just released a new version of GMail.
And here comes the bad news: my own developed Greasemonkey scripts stopped working because of the massive changes in the inners of the application.</description>

      <description>Today Microsoft has acquired 1.6% of Facebook, paying 240 million dollars. So the smart guys from Redmon (and their strategic consultants, of course) think Facebook has a value of 15 billion dollars! That’s a lot of money for a company with 300 employees! But it’s not about the employees talent, it’s about the 50 million active users of the platform where the value is. And it’s really high, around 300 bucks per active user.</description>

      <description>Last week I was talking with a friend of mine about my post Sometimes to interview developers can be funny{#i396}. We commented how most of the developers do not prepare the interview, and how they come without even visiting the website of the company. So, here goes some basic stuff you should do before attending to an interview. May be it can sound too basic, but believe me if I tell you that some developers do not care about this five topics:</description>

      <description>Today I have discovered the existence of G2One.com. This is the company created by the people behind Grails. Following the business model ‘It is all about the Services, stupid!’ they have jumped into the bandwagon of companies that:
 create a framework work hard to make it first class create or find a necessity in the community offer their services as gurus to the companies  37signals is the paradigm of this approach (they created Rails).</description>

I think Linkedin is the biggest professional network site with more than 14 million users (Via wikipedia).
It sounds like a very interesting place to work, a pity I’m not in the Bay Area. 🙁</description>

      <description>Previous: Setting up the development environment
The strategy One of the most important reasons why I have chosen Grails and not JRuby/Ruby on Rails is that I’m lazy and I do not want to throw away all my Java knowledge. But now I’m wondering if Grails will change too much the way I plan my projects. And what do I mean with ‘the way I plan my projects’? I mean the strategic decisions I usually take when planning my project.</description>

      <description>Previous: JRuby on Rails or Grails?
Once I have explained why I will use Grails I will go deeper in the development environment.
Methodology: Scrum One of the things I would like to test is how Grails works with Agile development methodologies. I’m not a ScrumMaster but I like Scrum and I would like to go deeper in this methodology. So I will divide the development of the project in two Scrum Sprints:</description>

      <description>I must admit it: I’m weak. During last two years I have been trying to avoid the dark attraction of Ruby on Rails. And it was hard. I have been searching for almost seven years something that alleviates my feeling of waste of time when developing a Web user interface. And I have been promiscuous, believe me. I have tried everything in the Java world: Tapestry, Velocity, Cocoon,Altio, GWT, Flex, Laszlo… I even tried ASP.</description>

      <description>Finally it seems that Ruby on Rails is starting to show its real face. Two years of RoR development put into the trash. Wow! Being seven times more productive than Java that means fourteen years of development! Seriously, it’s not common to hear of failures of a new and cool software stuff -you can look stupid- so I guess this is the peak of the iceberg of Ruby On Rails projects.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I made a search in Infojobs.es (the most popular Job Board in Spain) for open positions for Ruby On Rails developers. The result was… one! I was very surprised. Only one? With all the hype around RoR? Only one job offer?
It’s obvious that USA is more developed regarding technology than Spain, but the question is: How far are they? Can we measure the distance? Honestly I think it’s very difficult and probably comparing two countries is not the right way.</description>

      <description>There was a time when DBAs dictate how developers should use Their databases. It was early and mid-nineties and Their Word was The Truth. Those poor guys building client-server applications had to bow down before Him/Her and implement the Business Logic inside The Database Manager. Database hardware was expensive, but His/Her Highness could size the system easily because the number of clients connected was predictable. And that’s what the IT Manager wanted; predictable figures.</description>

      <description>Probably the only common thing among all developers I have worked with is the hate to bug-fixing. No matter if bugs belong to them or not. As a developer and as a manager I have quite contradictory feelings.
As a developer there was nothing more irritating than the hateful Bugzillaemails. When I was working as Technical Lead of a development team in Madrid with a QAteam in the West Coast of USA they usually started to work at our 18:00 and we usually left at 19:00 (Madrid is GMT+2 summer time).</description>

I don’t know if these politicians know anything about the IT and Telecommunications Global Market. How the hell are we going to attract foreign skilled workers?</description>

      <description>And I must be the biggest sissy of all. There is a lot of buzz{#ddz7} about designing your databases thinking in data normalized or denormalized. Now that everybody is building the next Google or YouTube the database design has to support trillions of transactions per second and millions of terabytes, of course running on a multidimensional computing grid of zillions of nodes of databases written in Erlang… Data normalization is common sense because helps you to avoid the Data Inconsistency Hell when data is repeated across different tables.</description>

There were rumours of delays because buggy software. The product was announced for shipping this summer, but the season was running out and there was not date for the product.</description>

Currently this is not an issue anymore because you can add automatically AdSense ads in your page thanks to the Blogger dashboard. But if you read blogs you will realize that some blogs embed Google AdSense ads inside the post. Most tutorials on how to monetize your blog recommends it.</description>

I have seen some projects in Europe, specially the Spanish Mobipay. It’s a mature technology, but it’s not very successful. There are several reasons but it’s not clear why mobile micropayments are not growing. In my opinion:
 The fee is charged directly to the customer.</description>

How end-consumers can drive the adoption of a transparent server-side technology? End-consumer sees server side services as a commodity, they don’t care about the technology running the service if the service is good, reliable and cheap.</description>

      <description>Evans data on his semi-annual Web Services Development Survey conducted in June says that companies planning the deployment of SOAwith a Java platform has increased slightly, but the companies deploying on .NET have declinedby almost 20%. .NET is still ahead with a 31% and Java in second place with 28%. 25% will support both.
It seems the reason is the increase of the activity of the Open Source world, specially Eclipse, around SOA.</description>

      <description>I have been testing Mingle, the new tool from Thoughtworks to manage Agile developments. The application really looks promising, and have a lot of new features that I’m discovering, but it’s taking me more time than I expected because it’s slow, very slow.
The guys from Thoughtworksclaim they have built the first JRubycommercial application. Probably true, but the price they have paid is high. The application is slow, and it’s slow even on a 2.</description>

      <description>I have just read the news in Slashdot (Yes, I still read Slashdot) and I found this very interesting article about a new technique to detect GPL violations in proprietary obfuscated code. The technique is called Birthmarking and basically it ‘observes short sequences of method calls received by individual objects from the Java Platform Standard API, which is part of the Java Runtime Environment. By aggregating sets of short call sequences the otherwise overwhelming volume of trace data becomes manageable.</description>

      <description>Surprise, Surprise! You can read in Jonathan Schwartz’s Weblog that they will change the NASDAQ symbol of SUN Microsystems SUNW to JAVA!!!!
The arguments are: ‘… the number of people who know Java swamps the number of people who know Sun…SUNW represents the past, and its not without a nostalgic nod that we’ve decided to look ahead…Most know Java, few know Sun…Java means limitless opportunity – for our software, systems, storage, service and microelectronics businesses.</description>

      <description>The day Steve Jobs said ‘Java’s not worth building in. Nobody uses Java anymore. It’s this big heavyweight ball and chain’ . Being a Java Zealot as I am, I should find easily a fist full of arguments, but may be he is right.
I have been working in the embedded and mobile world for almost four years in Amplia, and I can tell you that Java is far from being the best option for mobile and embedded development.</description>

      <description>Since the successful IPO of VMWare, it seems everybody is talking about them. Today we can read in Bloomberg that they are competing with Google for the best programmers. VMWare is paying $120.000-$130.000 plus stock ops to talented developers. Compared to the spanish salaries that’s really a huge amount of money. They have right now 500 open positions in Palo Alto offices.</description>

      <description>The Skype affair finally was over, but the price has been huge. While the markets are recovering from the drops of last week, eBay does not follow the trends of the markets. The image and reputation of Skype are now below zero. Just keep in mind that Skype is the one of the biggest (or the biggest) Telecommunications company in the world per number of registered users. Business and pay per use users will think twice before contracting them in the short term.</description>

      <description>I have interviewed a lot of developers, junior and senior staff and it has become like a routine. Technical workers are nice people, rude candidates are rare. Usually their (our) self-esteem make them (us) feel they need to show they (we) are over prepared for the job. The curriculum vitae are bloated with lots of technical buzzwords that most of the people have heard of, but can’t barely talk about them.</description>

      <description>I have not been able to use Skypefor more than 24 hours, just like the rest of the world. It seems that the problem is serious. It has been reported that it’s an issue with a new version of the application. But it’s not so clear. Such a long outage must come from (and I’m speculating):
 A failure in the data migration from the early version of the application and a bad (or nonexistent) rollback process.</description>

      <description>Being a Project Manager, Architect, Analyst, Developer or anybody involved in the development of software, you have probably suffered the 95 percent syndrome.Imagine a software development project where things are going reasonably well: things are on schedule, Quality Assurance says things delivered are OK, the customer feel the progress, people are happy because they don’t have to work overtime and they architect and developers can apply the Best Practises. You are very close to the end of the development cycle (if you are working with an iterative and incremental methodology) and confident about the result.</description>

      <description>Today I have discover Preezo, another web 2.0 presentations tool that looks like a killer for MicrosofPowerpoint.
The interface is mixture between Writely(sorry, Google Docs) and Microsoft Powerpoint. It’s surprisingly fast (faster than Google Docs) and you can build simple presentations very fast. If you are familiar with MS powerpointthen you can build a presentation easily.
The application allows to send by email the presentation, publish on the web and broadcast to the net and it’s also possible to embed it inside a HTML page just like any other web 2.</description>

He was(is) a very well known IT professional with an impressive technical background, but he moved to the dark side: management.</description>

      <description>DWR is the most popular framework to develop AJAX-style Web Applications in Java. It’s very mature and you can rarely find bugs or unexpected behaviours. I have been performing some tests with DWR in an environment without standard java server-side code (JSPs, JSFs, Servlets and web frameworks like Struts, Webwork…). All the code was static HTML, javascript and DWR dynamically generated javascript. The static content was served by Apache, and DWR code was served by Tomcat.</description>

It’s crystal clear that Venture Capital investors do not know what to do with their pockets full of money.
And no, it’s not a joke.</description>

      <description>Reading this blog about what he thinks a Natural Born Programmer is came to my mind a discussion about what is an excellent programmer and a natural born programmer.
The example given (detect if a number is odd or even) should be enough to differentiate between a natural born programmers and the rest.
But he is wrong.
This is the kind of solutions that people trained in Maths, Engineering or Physics can give, because they are smart people.</description>

This week Via has announced a new UMD reference design called Nanobook and Asus has unveiled an 3ePC, ultra low cost laptop . They are different races: Foleo is ARM-based with a limited amount of memory, Nanobook and 3ePC are x86-based. Nanobook uses VIA processors and 3ePC will use the new Tolopai Intel’s SoC. There are big differerences in memory (Foleo 256Mb, Nanobook 1Gb and 3ePC 512Mb) but not in storage and communication cababilities (all of them will have several gigs of Flash storage) and Wifi.</description>

      <description>When I read this post asking Microsoft to make .NET cross-platform, I wondered myself why they did not use Java -the one and only trulycross-platform environment-. Apart from the the obvious, Microsoft has very good reason to avoid making .NET cross-platform:
 The jewel of the crown is Windows, so opening .NET to OS X and Linux is like shooting on your feet. As Steve Ballmersaid he loves ‘developers’… because they build ‘applications’…for the Windows OS.</description>

      <description>One of the most interesting technologies to come are mesh networks. In Amplia we are making some prospects on these technology applied to the M2M (machine to machine) communication. Zigbeefits perfectly for small amount of data, but it’s not good when dealing with mobile communications (PDAs, laptops, MP3 players… anything interactive and portable).
The only real ubiquitousnetworks today are the mobile operators networks. GPRShas an acceptable deployment, closer to 100% of the population in developed countries, but 3G technologies are still far from being everywhere.</description>

Besides the sarcasm of the headlines, the newspaper says that the time of Isabel Aguilerain Google is running out, and she could leave the company very soon.
It’s not a surprise that she will leave the company (the surprise is she has not been fired yet). Reading the profile and curricula of this women, I wonder myself if Google contracted the wrong headhunter.</description>

      <description>Building a project for an start-up has nothing to do with building a project for a big company: people in the start-ups normally are betting their pocket money in the project, and this means that delays, unexpected issues and bad performance of the development team have direct impact in the life of the entrepreneurs. This is the reason why I don’t want to build software for start-ups: if you have a little of empathy with them, you will carry the heavy load of their personal problems, besides of your own company troubles.</description>

      <description>When I read the slashdot post about internal emails from Microsoft, I did not realize of the content of this email until it was posted in javalobby.
The content is scary. The mail thread comes from 1997, so after reading this emails, you can interpret the history of Java, .NET and Microsoft-Sun trial upon a several clear facts:
 Microsoft did not ever want to suport Java. Microsoft does not care about cross-platform.</description>

      <title>How to deal with &amp;#8216;The Toxic Engineer&amp;#8217;</title>

      <description>Excellent talk about how to Deal with the toxic engineer.
Things are very different here in the eastern side of the Atlantic Ocean: you cannot fire an employee because you want to, you only can fire an employee as the very last resort . Firing an employee in Spain usually is a pain in the ass for the company. The company must have things clear to take this decision.
So if you have the very bad luck to contract a Toxic Engineer for your team, may be you cannot fire him, and you have to pay him until he leaves the company.</description>

      <description>I have been tracking FON for two years, and I’m a ‘fonero’ since last summer. Recently I read about the ‘FON Liberator’ project, and it seems that finally the mystery of FON is over. If you analyze seriously the business model of this company and you have some basic knowledge about wireless networks, you easily find that something does not match. The original FON business model (and I say original, because now it has changed) was ‘share your bandwidth and you will have access to the enormous WiFi network of FON’.</description>

      <description>Since I started developing enterprise applications professionally (I developed video games when I was a teenager, but that’s another story…), I usually design the first version of the data models implemented in the applications developed (may be that’s the reason some people say my applications sucks…). I have worked with DBAs and Business Analysts, but it seems that the responsibility of putting in a E/R model the concepts it’s mine (well, except when I was the Technical Lead of Xpert Online in Adecco that I had the chance to recruit an excellent professional to perform this task).</description>

Can anybody explain what the hell has to do this with Sony?

      <description>One of our customers is going to launch a service in Europe and the US. Due to localization issues, he will start in a small (in population) country of Europe and the US. The scaling of the system for the European country is easy because the number of people that could use the system is limited, due to the language of the country. But the scaling of the service for the US is something serious: if the service is successful, my client could die of success if we fail sizing the solution correctly.</description>

      <description>When we started our first project with the Java Persistence API (JPA) and EJB3, we made some decisions about the design following the recommendation of ‘experts’ in the domain (see ONJava.com — Standardizing Java Persistence with the EJB3 Java Persistence API, for example).
One of the decisions was to get rid of Data Transfer Objects. We took this decision because we firmly believed that the new annotated POJOs could be used a Transfer Objects between the different layers of our architecture.</description>

      <description>In late ’90s we realized that the waterfall was an awful methodology for that time: lifecycle of the products were shorter and there are was something terribly wrong with the waterfall approach: it did not leave any margin for the intrinsic uncertainty of the projects.
So UML came to unify the OO modeling, and the (Rational) Unified Process looked like the correct approach to fix the structural problems of the waterfall and use OO modeling with UML.</description>

In my opinion, this is really good news for Formula One fans, since ‘crashes’ are one of the attractions of this sport event…
… and it’s good news for Kimi Raikonnen: now he can blame to M$ because of his bad luck.</description>

      <description>Update: some readers have pointed that I’m not using ‘average’ ‘median’ and ‘Arithmetic mean’ correctly. Sometimes we use ‘average’ as ‘mean’, and this is not exact. I have also removed the chart: I think average should read ‘arithmetic mean’. You can still check the chart in the original link. Thanks Pedantic ass.Update2: I have modified phrases using ‘average’ when I meant ‘ordinary’. Not the same thing, but can relief the confusion.</description>

      <description>May be one of the smartest business decision in the last decade was to embed Internet Explorer in Microsoft Windows. The browser was really a bad piece of software, but users did not need to install an extra application like Netscape -and configure it-.
Nowadays Internet Explorer dominates the browser market with more than 80% of the share. It scored 95% just a couple of years ago, but now new players are in the arena.</description>

      <description>If you don’t know DWR(Direct Web Remoting), you should check this framework right now. They define themselves as the ‘easy AJAX’ for Java. And they give easiness in the development, but they also give something not so easy to measure like increase in the productivity of Web developments.
Our experience with DWR has been more than satisfactory, and I will try to enumerate why I think so:
 First of all, it gives Java developers and HTML+Javascript developers TRANSPARENCY when dealing with information coming and going from the server to the browser.</description>

      <description>In Spain we are facing again a lack of workers with experience in development of not-so-cutting-edge technologies like J2EE. So, when you try to recruiter managers to take over the control of the new projects, these are the kind of managers you can find:
 Managers that does not really understand anything about development technologies, or even worse, nothing about development practices -methodologies-. So basically, they are not Project Managers, they are just people with some client facing skills, nice suits, may be good in ‘brown nosing’, but incapable of managing a team of skilled developers.</description>

      <description>It’s a year from now when the term AJAX was born, and everybody is getting crazy about AJAX-style applications. The fact is that Rich Internet Applications has been in our mind since the early creation of the web. I can remember terms like X-Internet, or products like Altio , Laszlo or Flex. But Google rules, and the Google hype has made Javascript the King of the Technology World.
You don’t need to go back in the past more than two or three years to remember phrases like ‘Javascript is not a serious language to build applications’, or ‘Never use Javascript except for simple things’.</description>

      <description>One of the smartest moves in J2EE (or JEE, who cares…) is how Hibernate has influenced the Persistence API. You can smell the Hibernate flavor. This API is a light wrap of Hibernate. If you are familiar with Hibernate, POJOs and hbm.xml files, you can start working with EJB3 Entities.
One of the magical things of Hibernate is how to retrieve graphs of objects ‘lazily’. You can do things like:</description>

      <description>Reading blogs most of the time does not give you any value, because 90% of the content is just people referencing other people. It’s good to know people opinions, but it takes some time to find good stuff.
This blog has really good stuff, POJO Mojo, and some times you can find pearls like this.
First, I really love Spring and I love all these new light frameworks growing thanks to the lacks of J2EE.</description>

      <description>This is really bad news for the open-source community. The CIO that supported the adoption of OpenDocument in Massachusetts resigns. He could not stand the pressure.
It is a shame what money can do. Nobody will believe that Microsoft is not responsible of this resign. Everybody knows ‘fair play’ is not an attribute of Microsoft strategy (anybody remember the ‘IE embedded in Windows’ affair? Shameful), but governments should take care of not letting these kind of companies do whatever they want.</description>

      <description>The article written in BusinessWeek Java? It’s So Nineties has dropped like a bomb in the community. Honestly I think he is right at some points, but this is the kind of journalism that makes me sick.
The writer is right about the maturity of Java: it is a dinosaur because of its size, but nothing else. The funniest part of the article is the comment about how ‘AJAX will replace JAVA’.</description>

      <description>Surfing the web I read this blog written by Ex-Google employers. Yes, there are people that have resigned from Google, believe it or not. One of the entries in the blog is this one: Xooglers: Let’s get a real database.
I have heard this sentence tons of times when comparing Opensource products with commercial products… This ex-google employee explains how they tried to migrate to a commercial database from MySQL in the AdWords service.</description>

      <description>It’s a funny thing this www.trabajobasura.com site. This spanish website helps you to know what the people say about a specific company. It is a fact that the spanish IT market is controlled by companies that basically plays the role of temporary staffing agencies. It is illegal to play this role in Spain (you need to be registered as a temporary agency instead of IT consultancy firm), but it seems that nobody will do nothing about this fraud.</description>

      <description>Today we read in the spanish newspaper El Mundo an article about one of the projects where the Opengate M2M Middleware runs succesfully connecting the remote devices on the back of the spanish pigs to a web portal application. The article is here (sorry, in spanish). The ham from the spanish ‘pata negra’ pigs are extremely delicious and expensive. It is possible to track the positions of the pigs, how many kilometers they walk, their heartbeats, the luminosity, or the temperature.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I saw in the news this headlines ‘ The City Council of Madrid will distribute software for citizens and enterprises for free’. The City Council has got an agreement with Sun Microsystems to distribute for free three million copies of StarOffice 7 and Java Desktop System. The market value of the agreement is 544 Million Euros.
skeptic as I am about politicians, I thought I would need tons of papers and bureaucracy.</description>

      <description>When I saw the new version of the Google Desktop 2 in the Google Desktop Download, I downloaded and installed it immediately.
It really looks cool, with some interesting stuff in the new Sidebar. Well, not very interesting for a Spanish guy living in Spain and not in the US… But Google is global and sooner than later I will be able to see the weather forecast of Madrid.
But… Then I tried to open the Microsoft Outlook 2003 (Spanish Version), and once it loads, then it closes itself suddenly!</description>

      <description>I have been managing (and developing…) projects in both technologies (Java since 1997 and .NET since 2003), and must recognize that time has only proven my fears about these technologies. So I will enumerate my thoughts about them, and why I do prefer Java:
 Company philosophy: Microsoft has a non-written rule of ‘deliver the product quickly, providing just 90% of the functionality’. Usually the pending 10% is always the hardest and most critical part of the product.</description>

      <description>When I saw this morning the news about the possible merge of
Nokia and Cisco I tought it was a summer rumour by an analyst with a fistfull of Nokia shares… but it seems it could be something behind the rumour.
Some facts about both companies:
 Nokia revenues for 2004 were at 29.3 billion euros Cisco revenues for 2004 were at 22 billion euros Cisco is valued at 100 billion euros Nokia is valued at 57 billion euros And it seems Nokia has 14 times more cash than Cisco!</description>

      <description>May be Linux is the most popular OS for server side applications in small environments, but still lacks of popularity in the desktop. As an example, buy a Wifi card and look for its Linux drivers. Surprise! The manufacturer includes drivers for all Windows species, but nothing about Linux.
Thanks to the Open Source Community, there are some good implementations of drivers for some chipsets:
 MADWIFI is a free implementation of drivers for cards using the Atheros chipset.</description>

      <description>Today I have received an email with a survey from JBoss. As an extract, it says …Due to ongoing demand from our users, JBoss will soon be launching a new Migration Services program, to make the migration from commercial closed-source application servers to JBoss more efficient… ‘.
I think they already have a migration tool for BEA Weblogic. I have already migrated some apps from Weblogic to Jboss (and from JBoss to Weblogic), and it is not difficult.</description>

      <description>Finally, BEA has released the final version of his long awaited Weblogic Application Server 9. You can start downloading the development version here.
It is J2EE 1.4 compliant, and it implements a broad range of new services dedicated to make the mission critical applications easer to implement and manage. Since most of the J2EE projects can run now on a Open Source application server platform, BEA has evolved his application server to make it different from the JBoss, Geronimo, JOnAS, etc…</description>

      <description>One of the most interesting projects recently is SopCast. The developers define it as ‘a simple, easy to use system to watch stream media on the Internet: a Network Media Broadcasting System’. Basically it allows to receive and broadcast video (and audio) signal using a P2P protocol, similar to Bittorrent. This means that while we are watching a broadcast we are receiving the information from multiple sources, and we are distributing the signal at the same time.</description>

      <description>When you have to build a prototype to find the approval of the customer, or just explore a possible solution to a problem, you don’t focus on a good Object Oriented design of the solution, or a detailed relational model (unless what your are trying to validate are these things!). You just focus on the problem you are investigating, or if the prototype has to do with the validation of the look and feel of the application by the customer, a nice User Interface.</description>

      <description>SBCs (Single Board Computers) are rapidly growing due to the raise of the M2M (machine to machine) and embedded industry (or is it the same industry?). While the number of manufacturers grows, the size of these devices shrinks. This ucLinux computer with 32Mb and 8Mb of FLASH running inside a CompactFlash card is a good example.It has been manufactured by C Data Solutions. The computer runs a Motorola 32 bit Coldfire processor MCF5272.</description>

      <description>I must admit that I have always hated Swing and AWT. It took me several weeks to (fully?) understand all the events stuff. Regarding the GUI, I was a VB guy, and that means dragging and dropping visual components. In the early days it was slow, very slow. I remember running a Swing application remotely in a HPUX server using a X server like a bad nightmare. So I dropped rich clients in Java and embraced server side development with Servlets and JSPs.</description>

      <description>I have found this article (spanish) about the cost of a data connection in Spain. It compares the different price plans of the three mobile operators in Spain: Amena, Vodafone and Movistar. It’s nice to see how prices have dropped dramatically in order to increase the traffic data, specially UMTS.</description>

      <description>This week I read a Business Analyst Report from Forrester: Application Server Platforms Q1 2005. I think everybody has read some paid reports from these analyst firms before, and I guess it is not a surprise to find conclusions that put on top of the rest of the competitors the company that paid the bill of the report (the sponsor).
But I don’t understand why these companies throw away their reputation makind this kind of public reports.</description>

      <description>I have read this post about the Google model of development. It seems that Google encourages creativity in different ways, but they even let workers to spend 20% of their time in non-Google projects. And in working hours, not spare time.
I really envy Google’s workers. The fact is that running a small company 100% (200% should be better…) of my time is dedicated to have success in our projects. If a project fails, we will have problems in our finances, and may be we would have to lay off workers… But working in a big company everything is about burocracy and politics.</description>

Well, this is not my first weblog, I had run weblog in spanish for almost a year, but I changed my mind, and now I think it’s better to run the weblog in english. Why? Just to practice the language… So please don’t be too hard with my spanish high school english.
Though in my business cards you can read ‘Technical Lead’ or ‘Technical Manager’, I think that I can define myself as an ‘Enterprise Architect’.</description>
